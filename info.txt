== Description ==
Adds a simple contact form shortcode to be used anywhere on your site.

The plugin uses the WordPress shortcode system, so you can place it anywhere that shortcodes work.

Here are a few examples:<br /><strong>[poppy]</strong> Creates a standard button with the word "Contact"<br /><strong>[poppy]Email me![/poppy]</strong> Same as above with custom text.<br /><strong>[poppy type="a"]Contact me.[/poppy]</strong> This uses a standard HTML link.<br /><strong>[poppy type="button" class="btn-important"]Email.[/poppy]</strong> Here we are using the bootstrap button, and adding a class.<br /><strong>[poppy type="label" class="label-warning"]CONTACT[/poppy]</strong> What about a bootstrap label?<br /><strong>[poppy type="i" class="icon-envelope icon-4x"]&nbsp;[/poppy]</strong> Finally a giant font-awesome envelope!
